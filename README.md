## Project Description:
The Simple To-Do List App is a user-friendly web application built with PHP (and some HTML and CSS too...). It allows users to:
- Add tasks
- View tasks
- Update tasks
- Delete tasks

The goal of the project is to practice PHP basics (like working with forms, sessions, and simple CRUD operations) and build a fully functional mini-app.

## Features:
- Add a new task
- Mark a task as completed
- Edit a task
- Delete a task
- Display tasks (all / completed / pending)
- Persist tasks using a file or database (for beginners: we can first use session storage)

## Tech Stack:
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS (simple styling)
- **Back-end:** PHP (pure PHP, AdminLTE, no framework)
- **Database:** MySQL (later implementation)

## Goals:
- Practice PHP syntax
- Learn form handling and server-side logic
- Understand basic CRUD operations
- Build a clean, simple project that could be extended later
