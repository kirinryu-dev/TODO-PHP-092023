<!-- config files are used to store application settings, constants, and configurations that are used throughout the application. This helps in maintaining a clean codebase and makes it easier to manage changes in the future. By using constants, you can avoid hardcoding values in multiple places, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies. Additionally, it allows for better organization of your code and makes it easier to understand the purpose of each constant.  -->
